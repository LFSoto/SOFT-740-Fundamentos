  In order to purchase items
  As a customer
  I want to add products to the cart and verify their details and total

      Scenario: Add products to the cart and verify their presence and prices
            Given I am on the start page
            When I navigate to the "Products" page
            Then I should see the title "ALL PRODUCTS"

            When I view the first product details
            Then the product name should be "Blue Top"
            And the product price should be "Rs. 500"

            And I click continue button on the modal
